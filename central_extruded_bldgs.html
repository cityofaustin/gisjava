<title>Demonstration of Austin area Building Footprints Extruded</title>

<p>This viewer uses <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/beta/">ESRI JavaScript </a> code to "extrude" building footprint polygons.  The primary purpose of this viewer is to quickly show building forms without installing new software or other overhead.  Move around by holding down the right mouse button to tilt.
Refresh the web page to return to the beginning view.  Slower video cards and internet connections may affect performance.</p>

<p>Buildings will appear to have sloping rooftops and other features like bridges will appear sunken since the elevation data tends to be "smoothed over."  Do not use this viewer to make site determinations.  This product is for informational purposes and may not have been prepared for or be suitable for legal, engineering, or surveying purposes. It does not represent an on-the-ground survey and represents only the approximate relative location of property boundaries.
This product has been produced by the Development Services or Planning and Zoning Department for the sole purpose of geographic reference. No warranty is made by the City of Austin regarding specific accuracy or completeness.
